The {{egg}} project uses e-graphs to provide a new way to build
program optimizers and synthesizers.

    <figcaption>
        An e-graph compactly represents
        many equivalent programs.
        These four e-graphs represent more and more (even infinite!)
        ways to write <em>(a Ã— 2) / 2</em>.
        {{egg}} makes e-graphs fast and flexible enough
        for use in program optimization and synthesis.

The core [{{egg}}](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg) library provides
high-performance, flexible e-graphs implemented in
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org). It is packaged on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/egg) and documented on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/egg/*/egg/), including a
[tutorial](https://docs.rs/egg/*/egg/tutorials/) that provides an
introduction to e-graphs and their use cases.

The newer [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog) 
 system provides an alternative approach to 
 equality saturation based on Datalog.
It features a language-based design, incremental execution, and composable analyses.

    abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},
